                <p>
                    For this case study, my team and I used user testing and interviews to redesign Jumpstart's mobile platform layout to ease the cognitive 
                    load of discovering the Saved and Applied jobs features and to reduce clutter.

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                While Jumpstart has potential and plenty of positives—a modern UI, a combination of features from multiple career websites, and
                a unique communities section—it is still early in development compared to other career websites. There are features that are less
                intuitive which we pinpoint through user testing and interviews.

            <h2>User Research</h2>
            <p>
                Our intended users, college students, have experience job hunting and can provide deeper insight through their experiences. 
                Even if they do not have previous experiences on career websites, it's highly beneficial to have fresh perspectives for insight
                regarding general structure and usability of the website rather than the functions and features. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Through background questions, tasks, and post-testing questions, we found that:
                <ul class="research-list">
                    <li>The Saved Jobs and Applied Jobs section was hard to locate</li>
                    <li>More users use the navigation bar as an entry point for searching for jobs and events</li>
                    <li>The two navigation bars (bottom and left of the page) are confusing</li>
                    <li>The number of members using the platform and the number of users online is irrelevant</li>
                </ul>

                We decided to improve general navigation and usability, focusing on locating the Saved and Applied jobs and adjusting the site's layout

                        The focus of this prototype is to preserve the core features of the original website to compare
                        and contrast with and restructure the main contents our interviees had issues with. We also aimed
                        to improve the overall organization, structure, and design a more intuitive navigation.

            <h2>AB Testing and Final Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                Our original goal was to create a seamless navigation feature for our users as we found through initial 
                testing that they were dissatisfied with where Jumpstart places their Applied and Saved jobs. Both of 
                our designs were succesfully able to combat this issue, confirmed through a second round of testing, with 
                Prototype A moving it to the center of the front page and Prototype B prompting users to use the updated 
                navigation features to find it through the menu. However, half of our user testing intially had issues
                finding the Applied and Saved jobs in the menu but became apparent once they pressed the menu option. About
                75% of our interviees loved the clean and modern initial Jumpstart layout, which we kept successfully in
                our redesigns.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through AB testing, we found that Design B was more successful due to the convenience and usability of the
                sidebar; users found it was easier to navigate and find pages and the side bar helped declutter insignificant
                information. Moving forward, we recommend incorporating the Design A's decluttering aspects such as including
                communities in the lower navigation bar, simplifyingthe header, and representing Activity has a bell in the 
                top right of the homepage.
