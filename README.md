## About
I redesigned my UI/UX portfolio website from the ground up starting with UI sketches and [high fidelity prototypes](https://www.figma.com/proto/SCd7qhqcjM2jAcmCGtmCMK/Portfolio-Redesign?node-id=1-5&starting-point-node-id=1%3A5&scaling=scale-down) on Figma, and implemented and deployed the lightweight web application using HTML5, CSS (Flexbox), and Bootstrap.

I emphasized responsive desktop-first design in this project, and learned a lot of soft skills such as how to set milestones, analyze progress, and adapt deadlines based on the milestones, pace, and debugging needs.
